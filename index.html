<h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>

<p>My name is Michael Byrd and I am currently a mathematics Ph.D. student at Clemson University working with <a href="https://cecas.clemson.edu/~burr2/" target="_blank">Dr. Michael Burr</a>. I received my M.S. in Mathematics from the
University of North Carolina Wilmington under the guidance of <a href="http://people.uncw.edu/hermanr/" target="_blank">Dr. Russell Herman</a>. I also
received my B.S. in Mathematics with Honors from UNCW. In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with my friends.</p>
