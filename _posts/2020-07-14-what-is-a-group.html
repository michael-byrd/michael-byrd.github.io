<h2>What is a group anyway?</h2>

<p>A group is a set \(G\) equipped with an operation \( \star \) that satisifies four axioms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A group is closed under the operation \(\star\). That is, for all \(a, b \in G\), we have \(a \star b \in G \).</li>
  <li>A group is associative. That is, for all \(a,b,c \in G\), we have \(a \star (b \star c) = (a \star b) \star c\).</li>
  <li>A group has an identity, \( e \in G \) such that \( e \star a = a \star e = a, \) for all \(a \in G.\)</li>
  <li>Every element in the group has an inverse. That is, for all \(a \in G\), there exists an element, say \(b\) such that \( a \star b = b \star a = e \).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples of groups include: the set of integers, rotations of a regular polygon, and the numbers on a clock.</p>
