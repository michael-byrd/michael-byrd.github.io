<h3>What is a Cauchy Sequence?</h3>

<p>A Cauchy sequence is a sequence, \( \{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \) with the property that all but finitely many terms are arbitraily close to each other.</p>

<p>Formally, for every \(\epsilon > 0,\) there exists an \( N \in \mathbb{N} \) such that \( \left| x_n - x_m \right| < \epsilon \) for all \(m,n \geq N\).</p>
